🏥Hospital Management System🏥

Introduction

This project is in Java and is built on OOP principles. This hospital management system includes three main sections: Admin, Department, and Pharmacy.

 In the Admin section, registration of doctors and patients is conducted, and lists of doctors and patients are viewable based on the departments they are affiliated with or admitted to. 

 The hospital comprises five major departments: Cardiology, Neurology, Dentistry, Eye, and Labs, along with additional emergency rooms such as Operating Theater and ICU/CCU .

 In the Department section, information about each department, operating rooms, and various labs is available, along with the services, facilities, and treatments provided.

 The Pharmacy section allows the addition and viewing of medicines for different departments. Medicines are organized department-wise for easy access and maintenance of records. Records are managed using concepts of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, and file handling is employed to handle and maintain all records in the system.
